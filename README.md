# ESP32_Push_Button_Lock
This project is a Push Button Controlled Lock System using an ESP32 microcontroller. It is designed to provide a simple yet effective method of electronically controlling a solenoid lock. When the user presses a button, the ESP32 sends a signal to a relay module which momentarily powers the solenoid lock using a 12V DC adapter, unlocking the lock.
